    <h1>Class application profiles</h1>
    <section>
        <p>This section attempts at reconstructing the profiled shapes for each class. The profile is deduced based on
            descriptive statistics presented elsewhere. The tables below contain the following columns: Property name,
            Cardinality, Property Type, Property Range and Confidence.</p>
        <p>
            Confidence is a categorial value derived from the property usage relative to the total number of unique
            individuals instantiating this class.Property range is a list of distinct encountered object types. In case
            of higher number of object type the list is non-exhaustive. Cardinality of the property is expressed in
            terms of minimum and maximum occurrences of the property. The minimum value varies from zero (0) meaning
            that the property is optional to one (1) meaning that the property is mandatory while the maximum value
            varies from one (1) meaning that the property is sufficient to star (*) meaning that the property is
            maximally unbound. Finally the type indicates whether the property range is whether a data type or an
            individual URI.
